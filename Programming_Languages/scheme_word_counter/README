This program is written in scheme, a functional language. It performs
a simple character, line, and word count on an input file. It then
takes a dictionary file and counts on the words, from the input file,
that match words in the dictionary file. 

There's nothing too special about this program except for we had to learn
to use a functional programming paradigm as well as the idiosyncrasies 
of scheme in a week. Also we had to use recursion to complete the calculations
which was a first in my programming career. 

All in all I am really glad we had to this project. Because of it I now
feel really comfortable implementing recursion and actually find it
kind of fun and challenging. Not to mention this is my last programming
assignment.....EVER!!!!!!! Goodbye computer science school!!!!!
