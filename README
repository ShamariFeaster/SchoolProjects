COP4020
Project 2

How to compile: 
Run the 'make' command.

Notes:
my yacc file is called 'example0.y' and my scanner file is called 'token.l'

Known Issues:
My grammar does not correctly handle strung togther expressions like:

a + b + b 

without parenthesis; however with parenthesis my parser will perform
correctly and produce a semantically correct translation and output

Addtional Info:
I have included a shell script I used in testing called 'cmp.sh' which 
accepts 1 command line arg which is the name of a calc file. Once run
it recompiles the parser, prints the output of the parser given the 
calc program, prints the c++ translation, and prints the original
calc program.
